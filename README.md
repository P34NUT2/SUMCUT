<h2 align="left">About This Proyect</h2>

###

<p align="left">Our project focuses on developing an artificial intelligence that functions as an academic assistant, with the objective of optimizing the way students generate and organize notes. To achieve this, we have planned it in two implementation phases.<br>In the first phase, we will work with a pre-trained model, which will serve as a base to transform a reduced set of main ideas or questions into a complete and well-structured note. The dynamic will be simple: the user will only need to write two or three central ideas from the class or some questions that have arisen, and the artificial intelligence will be responsible for elaborating a complete text that not only answers those questions, but also expands related information. The final result will be an academic note that includes a clear development of the topic, relevant definitions, practical explanations and, complementarily, links to YouTube videos and other resources that reinforce content comprehension. This way, the student will be able to save time, obtain quality information and have a tool that promotes autonomous learning.<br><br>The second phase seeks to go one step further by eliminating the need for the user to input ideas in writing. At this level, the artificial intelligence will have the capability to activate through the device's microphone, listen to the class in real time and, once it ends, automatically generate a complete note. To achieve this, the AI will transcribe the audio, detect the main ideas presented by the professor, organize the concepts in a structured manner and, like in the first phase, complement with clear explanations, examples and links to digital resources that strengthen topic understanding.<br>In summary, this project presents a practical solution to one of students' greatest challenges: taking quality notes while paying attention to class. In the initial phase, the tool will function as a note generator from key ideas, and in the advanced phase it will evolve toward an assistant capable of listening, understanding and synthesizing class information in real time. With this, we not only seek to save time, but also elevate the learning level, improve knowledge retention and offer an innovative resource that adapts to current education needs.</p>
